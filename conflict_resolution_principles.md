Conflict Resolution Principles
-------------------------------

Conflict resolution process within the progressive community should adhere to these principles

# Finding of Facts
Complaints shall be made based on the facts. The focus shall be on the facts regarding what actions were taken and what statements were made.
Scrutiny will be applied to disambiguate and set aside opinion, characterizations, assumptions, and speculation.

# First-hand Accounts Take Priority
Heresay, gossip, and other non-first hand accounts are set aside.

# Anti-Bullying Protections
Ad hominem attacks, character assasination, and other non-factual elements are set aside.
Behind the back attacks are not relevant.  All accusations must be transparently presented to the accused, and the accused must have an opportunity to tell their sire of the story.

# Relevance

# Identity and Experience
The identify and experience of all parties in the conflict shall be considered.  With respect to an individual's fears, goals, future actions, the individual is the sole posessor of the truth and shall have priority.

# Impact Lens
While intent, identity and experience may be at play, the process shall also take into consideration the impact of one's action on others shall be considered.

# Proportionality in Consequence
Any conseuqnces or punishment shall be proportionate to the actions and harms caused.

# Restorative
Consequences should be restorative and inclusive in nature.  No vendettas
